## Usage

### In Education
Blockchain technology in the education sector is primarily used to enhance the security, transparency, and accessibility of academic credentials and learning records like the MIT Media Lab’s . It allows institutions to issue tamper-proof diplomas, certificates, and micro-credentials that can be instantly verified without intermediaries. Blockchain also supports lifelong learning by securely storing academic achievements, giving le  arners ownership of their educational records.
